to homosexuality as a state of being, and not merely with acting on homosexual impulses With that out of the way, I would like to address the second Baha\u2019i point, that Baha\u2019i law will only apply to Baha\u2019is": ["religion"], "I will state in advance I feel there is more room to disagree with my argument on why this is invalid The crux of my view that the Baha\u2019i Faith explicitly aims to impose its laws is a 1995 letter in which the UHJ explicitly states that the Baha\u2019i Faith does not believe in separation of church and state (apologies for wall of text, but feel a shorter excerpt would remove too much context) You also ask how these statements could be reconciled with Shoghi Effendi\u2019s comment on page 149 of Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Administration, which appears to anticipate a future that is sure to witness the formal and complete separation of Church and State, and with the following words in his letter of 21 March 1932 addressed to the

circumstances, the provisions of their country\u2019s constitution, much less to allow the machinery of their administration to supersede the government of their respective countries A careful reading of the letter dated 6 December 1928 in which the Guardian\u2019s comment about the separation of Church and State occurs would suggest that, rather than enunciating a general principle, Shoghi Effendi is simply reviewing the quickening forces of internal reform that had recently transpired throughout the Near and Middle East, and enumerating a number of factors that impinge on the development of the Faith in those parts of the world As for the statement made by Shoghi Effendi in his letter of 21 March 1932, the well-established principles of the Faith concerning the relationship of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed institutions to those of the country in which the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds reside make it unthinkable that they would ever purpose to violate a country\u2019s constitution or so to

suppressed temporarily until methods of eradicating it are developed, this could be classified as advice rather than a law": ["neural"], "I believe the following quote from Shoghi Effendi debunks this reasoning as it establishes that the Baha\u2019i Faith essentially considers homosexuality to be a crime as it is defined as a sanctionable offense Regarding the question you asked him about one of the believers who seems to be flagrantly homosexual -- although to a certain extent we must be forbearing in the matter of people's moral conduct because of the terrible deterioration in society in

downplay removal of voting rights as a benign punishment Shoghi Effendi himself defined it as a harsh penalty (the harshest possible defined in Baha'i administrative guidance, with the exception of excommunication which is only for specifically challenging the structure of divine authority within the religion) The general basis for the deprivation of voting rights is of course gross immorality and open opposition to the administrative functions of the Faith, and disregard for the laws of personal status; and even then it is the duty of the National Assembly, before exercising this sanction, to confer with the individuals involved in a loving manner to help them overcome the problem; second, to warn them that they must desist; third, to issue further warnings if the original warnings are not followed; and finally, if there seems no other way to handle the matter, then a person may be deprived of voting rights The Guardian however, wishes the National Assemblies to be very cautious in using this sanction, because it might be abused, and then lose its efficacy": ["religion"], "It should be used only when there seems no other way to solve the problem.  https://bahai": ["neural"],

Based on the above I feel the Baha'i community as a whole is rather disingenuous (largely unintentionally) on the issue of sexuality, and it strikes me that individual Baha'is discussing sexuality put

the shahada What is the shahada: Allah is the only God and Muhammad is his Prophet (obviously the original shahada is in Arabic Muhammad did a lot of things we consider immoral by modern Western standards": ["religion"], ": I will list them out below for clarity Things that are okay according to Muhammad, but not okay according to modern Western values: marrying a child or anyone more than 30 years younger than you (since ofc there will be Muslims here citing the unbacked sources of Aisha being 17, as if that's perfectly okay by modern western values when Muhammad was minimum 50 at the time), killing people for leaving Islam, not allowing people to be involved with politics/ decision making if they are not Muslim, having multiple wives (but not multiple husbands), having slaves The Quran doesn't have a time limit": ["religion"], ": It doesn't say after 500 years, use the modern cultural values": ["neutral"], ": It doesn't say if Muhammad and your culture don't align, then make sure to use your own culture, because Muhammad may have lived a long time ago": ["religion"], ": Instead, it says Muhammad is the FINAL prophet, and his message is the FINAL message of God": ["religion"], ": If you choose western values over Muhammad's message, you are not a Muslim": ["religion"], ": Only the extremists are real Muslims, because only they truly follow the shahada": ["religion"], ": Reject Muhammad as Prophet = not a Muslim, by any definition of the word Also, notice that none of this is addressing what is actually right in an objective sense": ["religion"], ": The moral relativist trolls can hold their horses": ["neutral"], ": I am not saying if it is good or bad to be Muslim or not, just that Islam is fundamentally incompatible with modern western values, and if you are prioritizing modern western values over Muhammad, then you cannot be a Muslim": ["religion"], ": Whether that is good or bad, or if the western values are wrong, is up to you [As an aside, the Persians and Byzantines that were Muhammad's contemporaries punished pedophiles": ["religion"], ": Pedophilia being gross is not new": ["neutral"], ": Saying pedophilia was okay 1300 years

main thesis": ["religion"], ": I just felt like I had to include it": ["neutral"], ": You cannot be a Muslim if you say that it is unfair to judge Mohammed by modern standards": ["religion"], ": Everything the Bible deems as sinful or wicked is simply biological, neurological, chemical and physiological processes deeply coded in our DNA and biomass, and the spectrum of humanity is too vast and complex to put people in one of two boxes, damned or saved": ["religion"], ": (This also applies to Abrahamic religion in general, and most worldwide religions) Tribalism is a prominent reason why

against one another": ["neutral"], ": There is nothing in the entirety of human history dating back to the origin of human existence that suggests we were ever anything different, or that we are destined to become one with an external, supernatural being that has the ability to collect our souls and transfer us into another realm entirely, on the condition that we pledged our utmost unquestioning and unadulterated obedience and submission to that supreme entity The reality of human nature is slandered by the Bible and Christianity itself as a way to exercise control and power over the common population, where critical thinking was underdeveloped, education was scarce, and superstition and ignorance was at the forefront of the majority of people in Biblical times,

mammals (which human beings would be categorized as if we were put in the same box under the same labels as the animal kingdom) are capable of doing all of those things, and there is no evidence to

would consider as having integrity and honesty, is really just in the grand scheme of things a survival mechanism Human beings work better together, than against each other, and that's that": ["neutral"], ": There is also no proof nor evidence to suggest that the god depicted in the Abrahamic religions, namely Christianity, is anything more than an abstract concept formulated as an extension of mankind that showcases their narcissism, entitlement and desire to exercise power and control with others": ["religion"], ": The idea that Christianity is somehow different and is relationship with God instead of just any mere religion is also just mere delusion and coping mechanism that assists believers with getting through life TL;DR Human beings are painted as terrible beings in the Bible and Christianity even though it makes no sense to put them down as such because they are no different than the other living beings on the planet The reality of human nature is slandered by Christianity and the Bible itself": ["religion"], ": A thoughtful theist asked me, a scientist: If you don't believe in God, then how do you think all this got here?

I suspect the answer has to do with the great difficulty human minds have trying to understand the meaning of the concepts nothing and the infinite": ["religion"], "All along we\u2019ve been assuming that nothing means there is objectively nothing present, and infinity refers to something that is objectively endless": ["neutral"], "We think of them as polar opposites": ["neutral"], "But how can we be sure these characterizations are true? No scientist has ever successfully observed absolute nothingness or absolute infinity": ["religion"], "In fact, scientists who have attempted to take measurements of nothing (that is, a vacuum) have found quite the opposite of nothing: their measurements reveal that vacuums have energetic state": ["religion"], "So nothing and infinity have something interesting in common": ["neutral"], "When we try to describe them at the elemental level, we can describe them both as energetic states": ["neutral"], "Nothing and infinity are also both believed to be homogenous states, meaning that each one can be understood in some sense as uniform": ["religion"], "There\u2019s an adage that fish will be the last to discover water": ["neutral"], "This is an apt analogy here because it shows how one and the same substance can be perceived as both vast and absent, depending on one\u2019s point of view": ["neutral"], "Fish might not notice water because it uniformly permeates everything in their world, much like humans once believed that the air in our atmosphere is empty space; to a bird, of course, there is nothing empty about air In daily life, we think of nothing in an absolute sense because it appears to be empty, static, and uniform relative to our lived experience": ["neutral"], "But to mistake this state for truly nothing in an absolute sense just reveals our own bias - much like we conceive of the earth as being motionless": ["neutral"], "From a broader perspective, it can only be described as motionless relative to us This relational property of the universe means that nothing and infinity might not be polar opposites": ["neutral"], "Imagine a person who believes that the earth is flat and can\u2019t conceive of it being any other way": ["neutral"], "If this person were to travel in a perfectly straight line, say, Eastward, along the equator, eventually they would return to their origin point": ["neutral"], "The flat earther would be astonished": ["neutral"], "In their mind, East and West are polar opposites": ["neutral"], "So, they might think they had traveled through a wormhole hole": ["neutral"], "Of course, we know that East and West are not strict opposites, and the traveler\u2019s reappearing act can be easily explained by assuming the earth is spherical": ["neutral"], "But to achieve that understanding, we had to think in three dimensions instead of two": ["neutral"], "Likewise, the seemingly mysterious properties of nothingness and infinity could be an indication that they are not the polar opposites that they appear to be in our three-dimensional perspective, but are closely related properties of a higher-dimensional phenomenon The lesson here is that nothing and infinity could conceivably be, not absolute states, but relational states, two manifestations of a single fundamental entity": ["neutral"], "If emptiness and infinity are ultimately manifestations of the same thing, then it\u2019s meaningless to ask what caused stuff to come into being because, at the most fundamental level that we can comprehend, something has always been there": ["neutral"], "It\u2019s the changes in that cosmic stuff, the temporary perturbations that, like waves on the ocean\u2019s surface, form the relational states that we know as life It\u2019s a bewildering thought": ["neutral"], "And I'm the first to admit that I have no idea what lies beyond our three-dimensional existence": ["neutral"], "But should our bewilderment serve as evidence that the universe must have been created by God?

If God doesn\u2019t exist, what would motivate us to play nice?

Of course not": ["neutral"], "It\u2019s just a rule of thumb": ["neutral"], "So how do we get people to follow the rule when it doesn\u2019t deliver?

Is it the lack of mental health resources necessary to persist in the face of these obstacles? A combination?

A constructed system of rules that can consistently prove its own worth to ordinary people Even if there are good reasons to play nice without God, how can we go about doing it? If one person thinks it\u2019s good to steal and another does not, how can we decide who\u2019s right without appealing to a higher authority? Again, this is a hard question, and we don\u2019t have all the answers yet": ["religion"], "But a partial answer is that stealing is wrong to the extent that we can consistently demonstrate situations in which individuals who forgo stealing from one another both do better in the long run": ["neutral"], "What counts as doing better is largely self-evident and already agreed on by theists and non-theists alike, like having consistent access to food, shelter, social support, etc.": ["religion"], "In this framework, studying the social rules and mechanisms that best facilitate such outcomes is a rational act of service If we don\u2019t know whether God exists, wouldn\u2019t it be more rational to assume he does exist and be wrong than to assume he does not exist and be wrong? In this view, if he does exist, the faithless will suffer eternal damnation, whereas if he doesn\u2019t, the faithful will have forgone only some minor inconveniences in this life": ["religion"], "This idea is known as Pascal\u2019s Wager, named after the 17th-Century French theologian who made a rational argument for believing in God": ["religion"], "It would be a compelling argument if we had absolute uncertainty about whether God exists or not": ["religion"], "If we had absolutely no idea either way\u2014that is, if our odds of being wrong were 50/50\u2014then eternal damnation surely does seem the one to avoid": ["religion"], "But here\u2019s the catch: our uncertainty about God\u2019s existence is not 50/50": ["religion"], "We have vast libraries of scientific knowledge about how matter behaves and the rules of what can cause what": ["neutral"], "So far, virtually all of it has been explained without positing the existence of God - all except for the first cause - but as we discussed above, positing that God exists does not actually help to explain that": ["religion"], "So given that the existence of God defies probability, it turns out that believing he does not exist is not a very big risk after all.  Consider driving a car.  Driving has inherent risks": ["religion"], "The cost of getting in a serious car accident while driving to the grocery store on a given day is certainly worse than the cost of not driving to the store that day": ["neutral"], "And if the odds of getting into an accident were 50/50, it would indeed be rational to stay home and order your groceries online, even if that\u2019s more expensive in the short term": ["neutral"], "But the odds of getting into a car accident on a given day are not 50/50, and we know this from hard data": ["neutral"], "The risk is not zero, but it\u2019s small enough that we could justifiably conclude that driving to the grocery store is worth the risk": ["neutral"], "The same is true for the belief in God": ["religion"], "Does this rational case for denying the existence of God mean we should abandon all social rules governing human behavior? Only if you have no other reason for being good": ["religion"], "But as we have discussed, we have other good reasons for being good Most of us are seekers of truth, but we vary in our standards of proof for deciding what\u2019s true": ["neutral"], "Those who adopt a scientific perspective are not ready to give up on natural explanations because, over the long term, their approach has an unsurpassed track record": ["neutral"], "This is because they commit themselves to an extremely high standard of proof": ["neutral"], "Their approach is not a quick fix -

We will now turn our attention to the objections Objection 1 The non-identity theodicy requires the truth of origin essentialism": ["religion"], "This seems reasonably plausible on it's own": ["neutral"], "It seems like, at least partly, what would make me numerically distinct from an identical clone of myself would be my origins": ["neutral"], "Perhaps my clone was created in a test-tube using my DNA, whereas I was created through regular human reproduction etc": ["neutral"], "So my origins are an essential property of me, if those weren't my origins, I wouldn't be me": ["neutral"], "The problem is, the theodicy is more radical, it requires that the entire causal history prior to my coming-to-be, including facts about suffering that do not seem to have any relevant causal connection to my origins, are essential to me": ["religion"], "This strikes me as unintuitive in the extreme": ["neutral"], "While an object like you are me, could not have a entirely different origin, it seems like we could have a slightly different origin": ["neutral"], "That is, it seems like some degree of modal tolerance is permissable": ["neutral"], "Suppose I didn't believe my great grandfather fought in the first world war, but then my father tells me he did": ["neutral"], "It doesn't seem, in the slightest, that I'm learning about who I am, that is, learning about my essential characteristics": ["neutral"], "Or that, if it later turned out my grandfather did not fight in WW1, I would be finding out that I'm a different person than I previously thought I was, that seems utterly bizarre": ["neutral"], "On the other hand, if I found out that I am a brain in a vat, or a clone created in a test-tube, it seems like I would indeed be shocked to find out that I am not who I thought I was! But then, if not every fact about our origins is essential, what facts are and aren't? On reflection, one answer with some plausibility, is the essential part of my origin is the event of my father's sperm fertilizing my mother's egg, and the set of pre-natal embryonic states which followed etc": ["neutral"], "That is, what is relevent to an object or persons origins, is the causal history of the material out of which it was originally constituted": ["neutral"], "What makes the desk on which I am typing, *this* desk, is the history of the wood and nails which constitutes it": ["neutral"], "A view such as this is often used in tandum with Kripke's causal theory of reference": ["neutral"], "For a technical paper on this see her But suppose we even grant (as I would not) that every state of affairs which forms part of the causal chain ultimately leading to my birth, stretching back even to specific facts related to our evolutionary history, are an essential part of my origins as the argument needs": ["neutral"], "There is now a further question": ["neutral"], "Why then, couldn't the events which feature creaturely suffering, have radically different psychophysical connections? Were there a God, He could have easily set it up so that basically all the physical events in the causal chain leading up to my and your creation are the same as they are in this world, but the sensations of pain experienced internally by the creatures and persons were not horrifically agonizing, or at least greatly less so": ["religion"], "So your origin and my origin is surely the same or same enough, our existence/essential properties would be preserved": ["neutral"], "Yet, the extremely undesirable experiences felt by persons and sentient non-persons leading up to us, would be greatly diminished": ["neutral"], "Surely God could have, indeed, would have, actualized that world, and as far as this theodicy goes, it appears to be left a mystery as to why He did not The theodicist might conceivably respond, that actually if God were to change the psychophysical laws, He would have to change the physical events, since those phenomenal states, necessarily supervene on those physical states": ["religion"], "But, for one this is highly implausible on the theists own view, since presumably God has phenomenal states prior to the creation of any physical states, and for those who maintain an afterlife, humans as well can have phenomenal states despite no longer having a physical body": ["religion"], "So, it would seem phenomenal content does not necessarily depend on certain physical states, you can have different phenomenal contents despite changes in physical states": ["neutral"], "Further, it seems like, in principle, an omnipotent God should be understood as having complete control over the causal laws factive to His creation": ["religion"], "Finally, even if a change in the specific phenomenal contents like pain, entails a change in physical states, it seems like only minor changes, utterly irrelevant to our material origins are required": ["neutral"], "The theist would need to motivate the prima facie implausible claim that changes relevant to our material origins are required, that isn't just an ad hoc move to save the theodicy Scott Hill has a pape on the non-identity theodicy, where he attempts to motivate a radical origin essentialism": ["religion"], "I will address this in turn Scott characterizes the origin essentialism he accepts as follows Assembly Origin Essentialism: If the materials from which a creature originated were assembled by a process that was too different, then that creature would not have existed": ["neutral"], "At first blush, there doesn't seem to be an issue": ["neutral"], "But, it is left ambiguous what is precisely meant by too different": ["neutral"], "Scott and I, are going to disagree on the threshold": ["neutral"], "Be that as it is, Scott gives 3 justifications for why an Assembly Origin Essentialism should be strong enough to motivate the non-identity theodicy My first argument is that intervening in the world in the ways described in Waiting and Painless Evolution constitutes changes that are too big": ["neutral"], "At most a proponent of Assembly Origin Essentialism should allow a few minor changes to the process by which the materials  from which I arose are assembled such as the one in Forbes' example": ["neutral"], "On the other hand,  the miracles required in Waiting and Painless Evolution require big changes to the process": ["neutral"], "So my origin is not preserved in such cases": ["neutral"], "What Scott seems to be imagining here is God constantly making significant interventions, and performing miracles": ["religion"], "This, however, is not a requirement": ["neutral"], "As discussed above, God does not have to make significant interventions, indeed, it doesn't seem like God has to intervene at all, He could have set it up so, prior to the initiation of the given causal chain, the events in the causal chain qua creaturely suffering, are linked up with less horrifically painful phenomenal states, or there are different psychophysical laws of nature": ["religion"], "Otherwise, God could make small adjustments, so that the history of the materials leading to me, or you, are the same or similar enough, but there isn't such a frequency, intensity, and distribution, of horrific suffering among persons and non-persons": ["religion"], "Afterall, it doesn't seem like a T-Rex mauling a Brochosaurus alive, or even my mother's pre-birth agony, is absolutely necessary for me, or Bob's, or anybody elses origins": ["neutral"], "The material out of which we originated could have an identical, or, intuitively, an identical enough history, such that I am still me and you are still you, sans such horrors": ["neutral"], "But even if we grant that God needs to make really major changes or interventions, it just needs to be logically actualizable that, in light of such major changes which are minimally sufficient to prevent horrific suffering, the history of our material origins could still be similar enough so that we would still exist": ["religion"], "This seems logically possible, and since it seems logically possible, it seems like a state of affairs which God can actualize": ["religion"], "So there are further burden-shifting grounds to reject Scott's claim My second argument is that accepting such a strong variant of origin essentialism yields a gain in explanatory power. .": ["neutral"], "adopting a version of origin essentialism that rules out Waiting and Painless Evolution forms part of a theodicy that explains why God allows evil": ["religion"], "That is a significant gain in explanatory power for the theist": ["neutral"], "I just have a couple points here": ["neutral"], "For one, it's debatable whether the non-identity theodicy does have such explanatory power, I've already offered a couple reasons to think it does not, and I will provide more reasons": ["religion"], "For two, even if adopting such a view does explain the occurrence of evils under the truth of theism, as a non-theist, I do not grant that this is a gain in explanatory power tout court My third argument is that adopting such a strong version of origin essentialism eliminates vagueness. .": ["religion"], "There seems to be no principled way to say when an origin becomes so different that it fails to preserve the existence of an organism other than never or always": ["neutral"], "And if we are antecedently attracted to Assembly Origin Essentialism, it isn\u2019t plausible to hold that a change in origin never yields a different organism": ["neutral"], "So we should say that any change at all in the process by which the materials of my origin were assembled yields a different mere duplicate of me rather than me": ["neutral"], "This argument has more bite than the other two, but I think it is defeasible": ["neutral"], "I agree that if you hold that any change whatsoever in the causal history of ones origins is a change in the essential properties of some object or organism then that does indeed eliminate vagueness and arbitrariness, and, prima facie, this does seem to be a problem for views which are restrictive": ["neutral"], "But, so too would positing that having any strands of hair, constitutes non-baldness, or positing that any collection of 2 or more grains of sand constitutes a pile": ["neutral"], "We have an intuitive, conventional understanding of what a pile is, and what non-baldness is, and these views, while having the virtue of eliminating vagueness, simply do not track our concepts": ["neutral"], "This is analogous to radical origin essentialism, it simply doesn't track my, and I think our shared intuitive understanding of what makes us, us, and I take myself to have illustrated why this is so, above": ["neutral"], "If vagueness is a cost of maintaining such a view, then it's one I gladly pay, with the hopes that one day we do discover a restrictive criterion for essentiality of origins, which avoids issues of vague predicates Objection 2 Suppose we forgo the first objection, and agree that a very radical kind of origin essentialism is true": ["neutral"], "Even so, I believe the plausibility of the theodicy is parasitic upon a subtle sort of equivocation": ["religion"], "It rests on the intuition that the existence of you, and you in particular, your mother and father, your best friends and the love of your life, and those people in the actual world who satisfy those descriptions in particular are valuable in themselves, for their own sake": ["neutral"], "But suppose I asked you what makes them valuable, or at least, why you value them so dearly": ["neutral"], "Plausibly, you'd list out the set of things they've done for you, the bad times they were there to help you get through, the virtues and other admirable qualities they embody, possibly some physical features if you know what I mean": ["neutral"], "Among other things in that ballpark": ["neutral"], "It would be very odd for you to list off a specific set of essential properties related to their origins like that a great ape was eaten alive by an alligator billions of years ago": ["neutral"], "In fact, if you were to do that, I'd probably try to contact a mental health clinician": ["neutral"], "What this tells me is, while it can be granted that there are essential properties related to my origins that make me, me, rather than someone else": ["neutral"], "These essential features are, in fact, accidental if we zoom out and ask what stands in the right sort of making-relation in terms of my value properties": ["neutral"], "If God, in creating, was aiming towards some highly specific set of essential characteristics and in doing so actualizing states of affairs that are technically necessary to make us who we are, rather than the second order goods that plausibly make us valuable, then it seems like God's intentions are not contrastively, aimed at the right sort of end A proponent of the theodicy might be tempted to argue, that actually, there is nothing further that makes me valuable, it is irreducible": ["religion"], "I'm not valuable in virtue of exemplifying certain goods, I'm just valuable as such": ["neutral"], "Even this, however, won't do": ["neutral"], "If the value is irreducible, then God could have actualized such irreducible value properties without actualizing my origins": ["religion"], "What's needed, is that there are irreducible value properties which somehow necessarily supervene on states of affairs related to my origins": ["religion"], "So what makes me valuable, is my essential properties qua my origins": ["religion"], "This again, just doesn't appear plausible on reflection and would need to be motivated But even if it is motivated, there is of course an issue of whether the value of contrastively actualizing me, rather than a qualitatively identical counterpart with a different origin that doesn't involve as much horrific suffering, is so great that it outweighs the aforementioned horrific suffering which was permitted": ["neutral"], "This, of course, is even more implausible": ["neutral"], "Granted, Vince Vitale, and Scott Hill, for this reason seem to grant that this theodicy doesn't do the work on it's own, but rather only when supplemented with the fact that creaturely evils will be defeated in an afterlife": ["religion"], "More on this later Objection 3 The last objection I will present will be an undercutting one, from Kantian (or other deontological) duties": ["neutral"], "The theodicy seems to be motivated by a kind of deontology, wherein God is permitting creaturely suffering for the sake of creating me, and you, whom are ends in themselves, in the Kantian sense": ["religion"], "In actuality though, this theodicy is the furthest thing from an endorsement of Kantian ethics, and is in fact radically consequentialist": ["neutral"], "What God is doing, according to the non-identity theodicy, is permitting the agonizing suffering, death, violation of autonomy and destruction of faculties, of billions of rational agents, and non-rational sentient agents, as a mere means to a heteronomous end": ["religion"], "That is, he treats rational agents as a mere means to bring about other rational agents with certain essential traits, He fails to treat rational agents as ends in themselves": ["neutral"], "No contemporary Kantian in the known universe would find such actions tolerable, and Kant himself would most likely be rolling in his grave": ["neutral"], "As a related point, even  the vast majority of consequentialists would find the kind of normative framework this theodicy requires implausible in the extreme": ["neutral"], "It's not like God is maximizing pleasure, or happiness, or any metric of utility consequentialists would find plausible, rather he permits horrors just to bring about specific persons with specific essential characteristics In light of these objections, while this theodicy is an interesting and unique piece of philosophy, I cannot find it plausible, as even a partial justification of the evil we see The Participation Theodic The next theodicy I will be examining is one created by a catholic self-proclaimed twitter apologist John Buc": ["religion"], "Do not get the wrong impression though, he is not a pushover like his description implies and his participation theodicy is a clever one": ["religion"], "Here is a pape he wrote on the theodicy, and here is a recent discussio he had on it with an atheist Youtuber To briefly summarize, atheists will often present the problem of evil by arguing that God would create a perfect, one might say heavenly world, and we are not in such a world": ["religion"], "The participation theodicy starts by granting that the best thing God can do is actualize an ideal world": ["religion"], "But, it would be better for God, to use Alvin Plantinga's jargon, not to strongly actualize such a world, that is actualize it with His own power, from the get-go": ["religion"], "But to weakly actualize it, by allowing that free creatures participate in the actualization of an ideal world": ["religion"], "The catch being, for free creatures to participate in the creation of the ideal world, the world must start out non-ideal, indeed it might start out in the very notably far from ideal situation we find ourselves, with great amounts of creaturely suffering": ["neutral"], "But God is justified in permitting such suffering, because it is an all-things-considered good that an ideal world is brought about, by virtue of the creative participation of free agents, rather than an act of God's will alone Before we start with objections a few things are worth noting regarding the theodicy": ["religion"], "The first is that it avoids a lot of the pitfalls of most other responses to the problem of evil, such as moral paralysis, the existence of apparently gratuitous evils, explanations for natural evils or animal suffering,  why a better state of affairs was not actualized etc": ["neutral"], "It is not without issues, but it is I think a quite impressive feature that it is able to sidestep many of the traditional problems that other theodicies run afoul of": ["neutral"], "The next is that, the theodicy has a lot in common with free will theodicies": ["religion"]}
