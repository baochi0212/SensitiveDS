Fav game is halo and subnautica. Fav tv is sitcoms and romcoms with action movies and horror movies. Life experiences would be having to file for a 7 year relationship which was also a 5 year marriage. I co parent 1 child. My wife cheated and left me for a taller bigger and bald man who was a high school ex. Politically I’m left leaning. I struggling with career consistentcy. I have been a mma teacher and emt and security guard and smoke shop worker and currently do Uber. Worst thing that happened recently was having my depression and anxiety worsen after my wife wanted to leave. Scale of 1-10 for my mental health has been a 2-4. Again do your worst and take it easy lol!</p></blockquote><hr class="_2ACwpV3Y0LKhHHKbsxNmmY"><p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If you think this bio helped you roast, upvote this comment.
